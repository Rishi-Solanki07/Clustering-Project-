# Macdonald Customer Segmentation Project
**Overview**
This project aims to segment customers based on their characteristics using the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) dataset. The dataset contains information on 15 attributes for 1453 customers. The segmentation is performed using the k-means clustering method implemented in Python.

# Methodology
**Data Preprocessing:**
Imported necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Handled missing values and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data distribution.

**Feature Engineering:**
Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and extract important features.
Clustering:

Applied the k-means clustering algorithm to group similar customers together based on their attributes.
Visualization:

Generated various graphs and visualizations to understand the clustering results and interpret customer segments.

# Requirements
